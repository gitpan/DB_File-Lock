DB_File::Lock version 0.01
by David Harris <dharris@drh.net>


WHAT DOES THIS MODULE DO?

This module provides a wrapper for the DB_File module, adding locking.

This is useful for applications which need to have concurrent
access to a DB_File for two reasons: (1) you may want to save
writing out the actual flock call before tie and after untie which
gets old quickly. (2) you may be running in an enviornment such
as mod_perl where the un-flocking of the lockfile must be handled
by the DESTROY/untie mechanism to prevent a dropped lock. (see:
http://perl.apache.org/guide/dbm.html#mod_perl_and_dbm)


INSTALL

To install the module, do the usual:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test   (optionally set TEST_VERBOSE=1 or VERY_VERBOSE=1)
   make install


The test files in this module require a valid fork command.  If your
platform does not have fork(2), then please disable testing when
installing this module.
