Revision history for Perl extension DB_File::Lock.

0.03 Wed Feb  2 11:06:08 EST 2000
    - stupid me! version 0.02 didn't ship with a Makefile.PL, only a Makefile.old.
      seems that I deleted the wrong file before taring up the archive after testing.
    - Lock.pm didn't have $VERSION set correctly.

0.02 Thu Jan 13 20:19:44 EST 2000
    - much improved documentation
    - much improved README
    - added notes to other DB_File wrapper locking functions in POD and README
    - fixed some incorrect assumptions about flock(2) in test.pl that ended
      up being wrong on both Solaris and HP-UX and caused two tests to fail.
